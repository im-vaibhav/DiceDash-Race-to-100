DiceDash is a fun and fast-paced two-player dice game built with JavaScript. The goal is simple — be the first to reach 100 points. But beware: roll a 1, and you’ll lose your turn and your current score!

🚀 How to Play

Roll the Dice: On your turn, click the Roll Dice button.

Scoring:

If you roll 2–6, that number is added to your current score.

If you roll a 1, you lose your current score and your turn ends.

Hold: You can choose to "Hold" at any time to add your current score to your total score and pass the turn to your opponent.

Win the Game: The first player to reach 100 total points wins the game!
